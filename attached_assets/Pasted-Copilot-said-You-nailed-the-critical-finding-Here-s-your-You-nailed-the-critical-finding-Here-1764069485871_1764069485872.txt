You nailed the critical finding! Here’s your root cause, diagnosis, and precise fix recommendations:

Diagnosis
Frontend normalization uses Title Case (e.g., "Swamp|SPM").
Backend requests and logic use lowercase (e.g., "swamp (SPM)").
Cache keys are stored/retrieved using Title Case.
When data from the backend is added to cache, its key is likely in lowercase ("swamp|SPM"), but lookups are done with Title Case ("Swamp|SPM").
End Result:
Cache never matches for "Swamp" and "Sol Ring" (missing entries).
Only "Lightning Bolt" works because somewhere, its casing happens to align between backend and frontend (or cache is manually populated for that case).
What’s Actually Happening?
You fetch the backend with lowercase, but store or lookup cache with Title Case.
The cache might actually have "swamp|SPM", but the component requests "Swamp|SPM"—so getPrice returns N/A.
How To Fix:
Make All Cache Keys Case-Insensitive and Consistently Formatted

Standardize all cache key generation and lookups—both for storing and retrieving—to the same format.
Lowercase card name
Uppercase set code (or whatever you use, but must match the storing pattern!)
Implement This in Your Normalization Code:

js
function normalizeCardName(name) {
  return name.trim().toLowerCase(); // Always lowercase!
}
function normalizeSetCode(set) {
  return set.trim().toUpperCase(); // If set codes are uppercase in your system
}
When you store in cache:

Use: const key = normalizeCardName(name) + '|' + normalizeSetCode(set)
When you retrieve from cache:
Use: getPrice(normalizeCardName(name), normalizeSetCode(set))
Check Everywhere!

Wherever your frontend stores or fetches prices, enforce and document the exact normalization used.
Example Correction
js
const cardName = normalizeCardName(name); // always lowercase
const setCode = normalizeSetCode(set);    // always uppercase
const key = `${cardName}|${setCode}`; // cache key format for both storing/fetching
If your backend also uses lowercase name + uppercase set, you'll always hit the right cache entry.
Bottom Line
Your cache is missing hits for Swamp and Sol Ring there’s a key-format mismatch. Fix normalization so storing and retrieving always use cardname.toLowerCase()|setCode.toUpperCase() (or a consistent format both sides use).

Quick Diagnostic Confirmation To Try:
Open your cache data directly and look for "swamp|SPM", "sol ring|EOC", etc.
Change your normalization and rerun—Swamp price should immediately display!
Summary Table
Card Name	Set Code	Normalized Key Used (Currently)	Cache Key Possible	Expected Behavior
Lightning Bolt	M11	"Lightning Bolt	M11"	(matches by luck)
Sol Ring	EOC	"Sol Ring	EOC"	"sol ring
Swamp	SPM	"Swamp	SPM"	"swamp
Fix so both storing and retrieving always uses "swamp|SPM", "sol ring|EOC", etc. with the same case/format!

Action Steps
Update normalization for cache key everywhere.
Check, rerun, and prices will appear for basic lands and all other cards.
