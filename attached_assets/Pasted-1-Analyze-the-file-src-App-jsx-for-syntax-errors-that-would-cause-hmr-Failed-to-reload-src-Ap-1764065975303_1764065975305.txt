1. Analyze the file /src/App.jsx for syntax errors that would cause:

[hmr] Failed to reload /src/App.jsx


Specifically check for:

Missing export default App;

Unclosed JSX tags

Unclosed { or ( braces

Accidental extra } or )

Duplicate component definitions

A function or block that is cut off and not closed properly

A stray character that breaks the AST

Any merge artifact like <<<<<<< or =====

2. Validate component structure:
Ensure the file has:

function App() {
   ...
}
export default App;


If export default App; is missing, add it.

3. Validate the fetchCardPrices definition:
Make sure it appears only once and looks exactly like this:

const fetchCardPrices = async (cardName, setCode) => {
  try {
    let normalizedSet = (setCode || "").trim().toUpperCase();

    if (!normalizedSet || normalizedSet === "BASIC LAND" || normalizedSet === "BASICLAND") {
      normalizedSet = "SPM";
    }

    const response = await fetch(
      `${API_BASE}/price?name=${encodeURIComponent(cardName)}&set=${encodeURIComponent(normalizedSet)}`
    );

    if (response.ok) {
      const priceData = await response.json();
      return {
        tcg: priceData.tcg || "N/A",
        ck: priceData.ck || "N/A",
      };
    }
  } catch (err) {}

  return { tcg: "N/A", ck: "N/A" };
};


If there is any other version of fetchCardPrices, delete it.

4. Search for spots where setCode might be undefined or lowercased.
Replace any usage like:

card.set
cardSet
item.set


With:

(card.set || "").toUpperCase()


This prevents Swamp/lands returning “N/A”.

5. Run ESLint / Syntax checker inside Replit.
Tell me exactly where the syntax error is and fix it.

6. After applying fixes, force a Vite rebuild:
Run:

npm run dev


or restart the Replit workspace environment so HMR loads updated code.

7. Confirm that market prices in Inventory now load correctly for:

Swamp

Lightning Bolt

Sol Ring

Test by forcing the component to re-render after the HMR fix.

✔ Why TMT Swamp Was Even Mentioned

Because your frontend was sending an empty or undefined setCode, triggering your fallback rule:

if (!normalizedSet) normalizedSet = "SPM";


So TMT Swamp was never real, it was just your code falling back to a default set in a broken state due to the HMR failure.

Once HMR is fixed and setCode is properly uppercase, this disappears automatically.
