The Issue
Swamp (and likely other basic lands) correctly receive backend price data but display N/A in the frontend.
Other cards like Lightning Bolt and Sol Ring render prices as expected.
Areas Most Likely to Cause the Problem
1. Prop Mismatch:
If name or set are not normalized correctly (or are undefined/null), normalizeCardName()/normalizeSetCode() may send invalid keys to the cache, resulting in N/A fallback.

2. Cache Key Format:
If normalizeCardName(name) or normalizeSetCode(set) output a value that doesn’t match the cache, getPrice won’t return the price. For Swamp, test what’s actually passed:

js
const cardName = normalizeCardName(name); // Console log this
const setCode = normalizeSetCode(set);    // And this
Check your cache for what key actually exists—does it match?

3. Data Format Returned from Cache:
If getPrice(cardName, setCode) returns undefined/null or unexpected data, your destructuring into { tcg, ck } will go fallback to "N/A".

4. useEffect Dependencies:
If name, set, or getPrice don’t change (or change unexpectedly), the price may not update or may get stale data.

Step-By-Step Debug Suggestions
A. Log Everything!
Add this to your component for Swamp and check browser console:

js
useEffect(() => {
  const cardName = normalizeCardName(name);
  const setCode = normalizeSetCode(set);
  console.log("Normalized cardName:", cardName, "Normalized setCode:", setCode);
  getPrice(cardName, setCode).then(result => {
    console.log("Price returned for", cardName, setCode, ":", result);
    setPrice(result);
  });
}, [name, set, getPrice]);
B. Check the Cache Key
Is getPrice("swamp", "SPM") producing the same key that the backend/cache uses?
What is in the cache? Is it "swamp|SPM" or something else (e.g., "Swamp|SPM", "swamp|")?
C. Inspect normalizeCardName and normalizeSetCode
Is there different normalization logic for "Swamp" vs "Lightning Bolt"? Case sensitivity, special character removal, whitespace, etc.?
D. Return Value of getPrice
Does getPrice() ever return just {} or undefined?
Are you sure it always returns { tcg: "...", ck: "..." }?
Hypotheses
Normalization Issue:
If Swamp is capitalized, normalized, or treated differently, the cache lookup may miss and fallback to N/A.
Cached Data Not Populated:
Maybe Swamp’s price is returned to the backend, but the frontend never stores it in the cache due to a key mismatch.
Undefined Prop:
If the InventoryTab passes missing set or name, normalization might return something unusable ("" or undefined).
Concrete Next Steps
Add the Proposed Logging to see:

What cardName and setCode become/is for Swamp.
What the cache returns for these values.
Check the Cache Directly:

Inspect the context. Does it contain an entry for Swamp with the expected key?
Is the value exactly as expected?
Compare Against Working Example:

What’s different between a working card (Lightning Bolt) and Swamp in the actual prop values and cache keys?
Likely Fixes
Fix normalization for basic lands, ensuring normalizeCardName("Swamp") matches what’s stored.
Verify cache is correctly populated with "swamp|SPM" (or whatever is expected).
Check that backend returns exact case and set code that normalization expects.
If you post the console output from the logging step, I can help you pinpoint exactly where the key mismatch occurs and suggest a code fix (either to normalization or to population of the cache)!
