Problem Summary
In src/components/InventoryTab.jsx, the expanded section for inventory cards appears wider than the card itself because the card and expanded section are siblings - the card respects the CSS grid column width, but the expanded section is unconstrained.

Solution
Restructure the component so the expanded content renders inside the Card component, not as a separate sibling below it. This ensures both the card and its expanded content share the same width constraints from the parent grid.

Implementation Steps
In renderCardGroup function (around lines 125-245):

Remove the expanded section from being a sibling of the Card
Move the expanded content inside the Card component
When isExpanded is true, the Card should grow in height to accommodate the expanded content instead of rendering a separate container below
Structural change needed:

jsx
// CURRENT STRUCTURE (problematic):
<div>
  <Card>... </Card>           {/* Constrained by grid */}
  {isExpanded && <div>... </div>}  {/* NOT constrained - this is the bug */}
</div>

// DESIRED STRUCTURE (fixed):
<Card>
  {/* Normal card content */}
  {isExpanded && (
    {/* Expanded content INSIDE the card */}
  )}
</Card>
Remove the fixed height (h-32) from the Card when expanded, or use conditional height:

When collapsed: h-32 (or similar fixed height)
When expanded: h-auto or remove height constraint
Keep the expanded content styling but ensure it's nested inside the Card's boundaries

Expected Result
When a user clicks to expand a card, the additional content should appear within the same card container, maintaining the exact same width as the card header. The card should grow vertically to fit the content, not spawn a separate wider container below it.
