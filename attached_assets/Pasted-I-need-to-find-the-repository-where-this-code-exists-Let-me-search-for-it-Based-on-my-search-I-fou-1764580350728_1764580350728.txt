I need to find the repository where this code exists. Let me search for it.Based on my search, I found the code in the **BigDeckClub/BigDeckAppV3** repository. Let me provide Replit with a clear summary of the issue and solution:

## Issue Summary: Bell Icon Not Working for Low Inventory Alerts

### Root Cause
The **"Out of Stock" section's `CardGroup` components are missing the `onToggleLowInventory` and `onSetThreshold` props**. While the in-stock cards receive these props, the out-of-stock cards do not, causing the bell button click to do nothing.

### The Problem Flow
1. When you click the bell, `handleToggleLowInventory` is called
2. It checks `if (onToggleLowInventory)` before making the API call
3. For out-of-stock cards, `onToggleLowInventory` is **undefined** (not passed as a prop)
4. So the API call is silently skipped - no error, no action

### Solution
In **`InventoryTab.jsx`** around line 1723-1737, find where the out-of-stock `CardGroup` components are rendered and add the missing props:

```jsx
// Add these props to the out-of-stock CardGroup components:
onToggleLowInventory={async (itemId) => {
  try {
    await fetch(`/api/inventory/${itemId}/toggle-alert`, { method: 'POST' });
    onLoadInventory?.();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error toggling alert:', error);
  }
}}
onSetThreshold={/* same handler as in-stock cards */}
```

### Secondary Issue to Check
The `e.stopPropagation()` in `handleToggleLowInventory` should prevent the parent card's `onClick` from firing, but verify that:
1. The button's `onClick` is correctly calling `handleToggleLowInventory(items[0], e)` 
2. The event object `e` is being passed correctly

### Quick Debug Tip
Add a `console.log` at the start of `handleToggleLowInventory` to confirm it's being called, and another to check if `onToggleLowInventory` exists:

```javascript
const handleToggleLowInventory = async (item, e) => {
  console.log('Bell clicked for item:', item.id);
  console.log('onToggleLowInventory exists:', !!onToggleLowInventory);
  // ... rest of function
};
```
