Problem Statement
We're building an MTG (Magic: The Gathering) card inventory management app and need to fetch Card Kingdom prices for cards. The app successfully fetches TCG prices from Scryfall API, but Card Kingdom pricing has proven impossible to retrieve despite multiple approaches.

Goal
Fetch Card Kingdom prices for cards like "Sol Ring" from various sets (e.g., Edge of Eternities Commander, Doctor Who) so they display alongside TCG prices in our inventory tracker.

URL Format
The correct Card Kingdom URL format is:

https://www.cardkingdom.com/mtg/edge-of-eternities-commander-decks/sol-ring
Pattern: cardkingdom.com/mtg/{set-name-slug}/{card-name-slug}
Troubleshooting Summary
Attempt 1: Direct Web Scraping with Cheerio

Approach: Simple fetch + HTML parsing with CSS selectors
Result: HTTP 403 Forbidden
Error: Card Kingdom returned status 403 before we could access HTML
Console logs confirmed: "Status Code: 403, Status Text: Forbidden, Response OK?: false"
Attempt 2: Improved Web Scraping with Better Headers

Approach: Added realistic User-Agent, Accept headers, Sec-Fetch headers to mimic browser
Result: Still HTTP 403 Forbidden
Error: Even with comprehensive browser-like headers, Card Kingdom blocked the request
Evidence: Every request attempt returned 403
Attempt 3: Puppeteer Headless Browser Rendering

Approach: Use headless Chrome to render page like real user, bypassing bot detection
Code: puppeteer.launch() with page rendering
Result: Failed with system library error
Error: Failed to launch the browser process: libglib-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file
Why it failed: Replit environment lacks required system dependencies for Chromium
Attempt 4: MTGJSON API (Third-Party Aggregator)

Approach: Fetch Card Kingdom prices from MTGJSON's official data (they aggregate pricing)
Endpoints tried:
https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/cards.json (master dataset)
https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/{SETCODE}.json (set-specific)
Result: API responds with 200 OK but Card Kingdom price data isn't present in response structure
Console logs: "Trying MTGJSON set-specific endpoint... === FINAL RESULT === Card Kingdom Price: N/A"
What We Know
Working ✅

Scryfall API works perfectly - retrieves card data, TCG prices, set names
Backend successfully fetches and processes Scryfall responses
URL construction with set names works correctly
Not Working ❌

Any direct HTTP request to Card Kingdom (HTTP 403 Forbidden)
Web scraping via Cheerio (blocked at HTTP level before HTML parsing)
Browser-like headers and realistic User-Agent strings (still blocked)
Puppeteer headless browser (system dependencies unavailable on Replit)
MTGJSON API aggregator (data not in expected format or not available for CK)
Environment Context
Runtime: Node.js on Replit
Cannot install additional system libraries due to platform limitations
Backend uses Express.js
Frontend uses React + Vite
Question for Claude
What additional approaches could we try to retrieve Card Kingdom pricing without:

Direct web scraping (blocked with 403)
Headless browser rendering (no system libs available)
Official Card Kingdom API (doesn't exist)
Third-party aggregators (data missing)
Or should we:

Accept that CK prices are unavailable and remove this feature?
Contact Card Kingdom for partnership data access?
Use a paid proxy/scraping service?
