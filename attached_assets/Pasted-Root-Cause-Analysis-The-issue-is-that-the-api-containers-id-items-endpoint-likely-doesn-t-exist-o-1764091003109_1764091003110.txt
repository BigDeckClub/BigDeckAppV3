Root Cause Analysis
The issue is that the /api/containers/:id/items endpoint likely doesn't exist or isn't returning the correct data structure. Looking at your code, I can see two different approaches being used:

Line 707: toggleContainerExpand() tries to fetch from /api/containers/${containerId}/items
Line 561: loadContainers() also tries to preload items from the same endpoint
However, based on how containers are created in your backend, the cards are probably stored directly in the containers table as a JSONB cards column, not as a separate endpoint.

The Problem
When you create a container (via addContainer() on line 687), you send:

JavaScript
{
  name: containerName,
  decklist_id: parseInt(selectedDecklist)
}
The backend likely processes the decklist, pulls cards from inventory, and stores them in a cards JSONB column. But your frontend is trying to fetch from /api/containers/:id/items which probably:

Doesn't exist as an endpoint, OR
Returns an empty array because items aren't stored separately
The Fix
You have two options:

Option 1: Return cards directly in the container object (Recommended)
Modify your backend so that when you fetch containers via GET /api/containers, it includes the cards array:

JavaScript
// Backend should return:
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Modern Deck",
  decklist_id: 5,
  cards: [
    { name: "Swamp", set: "UNF", quantity_used: 5, purchase_price: 0.10, inventoryId: 123 },
    { name: "Lightning Bolt", set: "2X2", quantity_used: 4, purchase_price: 2.50, inventoryId: 456 }
  ]
}
Then update your frontend loadContainers():

JavaScript
const loadContainers = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/containers`);
    const data = await response.json();
    setContainers(data || []);

    // Store cards directly from container response
    if (data && data.length > 0) {
      const itemsMap = {};
      data.forEach(container => {
        itemsMap[container.id] = container.cards || [];
      });
      setContainerItems(itemsMap);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Load containers error:', error);
  }
};
And simplify toggleContainerExpand():

JavaScript
const toggleContainerExpand = (containerId) => {
  setExpandedContainers((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    [containerId]: !prev[containerId],
  }));
};
Option 2: Create the /items endpoint
If you want to keep the separate endpoint approach, create it in your backend:

JavaScript
// Backend route
app.get('/api/containers/:id/items', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const result = await db.query(
    'SELECT cards FROM containers WHERE id = $1',
    [id]
  );
  
  if (result.rows.length === 0) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Container not found' });
  }
  
  res.json(result.rows[0].cards || []);
});
