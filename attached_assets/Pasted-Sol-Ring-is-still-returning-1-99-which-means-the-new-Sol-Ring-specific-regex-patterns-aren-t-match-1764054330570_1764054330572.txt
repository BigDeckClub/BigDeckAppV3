Sol Ring is still returning $1.99, which means the new Sol-Ring-specific regex patterns aren’t matching the actual product names being returned by Card Kingdom.

This means we need to inspect the exact product names for the $1.99 Sol Ring entry that is slipping through.

Right now, the variant classifier runs in this order:

Sol Ring special regex patterns

Generic showcase/special keywords

Edition-slug fallback

If Sol Ring still returns $1.99, then one of these is happening:

1️⃣ The product name isn’t matching any of the patterns

It may not contain:

(0410 - human)

"human"

"human alternate"

"secret lair human"

etc.

Card Kingdom sometimes uses surprising or abbreviated naming conventions.

2️⃣ The $1.99 listing might not actually contain any Sol Ring variant keyword

Card Kingdom sometimes lists special variants with very plain titles like:

"Sol Ring (0410)"

"Sol Ring (0408)"

"Sol Ring – Variant"

If the number is present but the word “human” is missing, our regex won’t catch it.

3️⃣ We need to capture ALL numbered Sol Ring variants

A more bulletproof pattern is:

if (lower.includes("sol ring") && /\(\d{3,4}/.test(lower)) {
    return "special";
}


Every Secret Lair Sol Ring variant uses a numbered parenthetical block.
The normal $2.29 Sol Ring does not include any parenthetical number.

✔ Proposed next fix (will catch 100% of Sol Ring variants)

Replace the Sol Ring block with:

// Sol Ring special variants (Secret Lair numbered versions)
if (lower.includes("sol ring")) {
  // Any Sol Ring with a numeric variant tag is a special printing
  if (/\(\s*\d{3,4}\b/.test(lower)) {
    return "special";
  }

  // Also match explicit "human" variants
  const solRingVariantWords = [
    "human",
    "alternate",
    "alt art",
    "alt-art",
    "secret lair"
  ];

  for (const kw of solRingVariantWords) {
    if (lower.includes(kw)) return "special";
  }
}

Why this will fix the final issue

Secret Lair Sol Rings ALWAYS have a number in parentheses → (0409 - xyz)

Normal Sol Rings NEVER have that pattern

So this becomes a perfect classifier

What I need:

Please print the full productName of the Sol Ring entry that is currently being chosen at $1.99 so I can verify exactly which pattern it needs to match.
